The notation of a move is the accepted standard for 10x10 boards.
A move is given by the start and end fields of the move or capture.
Examples:
- 32-28, 19-23, 5-46, ... for moves of a piece or king
- 28x19, 5x46, ...        for captures of a piece or king
If a capture cannot be uniquely defined by the start and end fields,
you had to record all fields like: m 26x17x28x39x30

The application is tested with Linux Mint and MobyDam as server.
It can connect to any other draughts server which support the DXP protocol.
I am not sure but I am not surprised if it works for other platforms
like macOS or Windows.
If you have problems with displaying pieces, try switching to the ASCII pieceset.

Two logfiles are maintained:
- mydxp.log: stores the dxp messages exchanged between client and server.
- mysys.log: stores general events during running the application.
